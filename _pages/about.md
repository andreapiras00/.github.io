## About me!

![Illustration of a network](/images/network.png){: .align-right width="500px"}
👨🏻‍💻 I'm a first year PhD student at University of Illinois Chicago.
- My advisor is Professor [Elena Zheleva](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~elena/)

🔬 My research interests are causal inference and graph-based learning

📚 I'm currently working towards my next papers on causality:
- 2024 Moldova elections interference
- Calcium imaging of Dentate Gyrus (DG) on mice 


## 🎓 Education
I hold a **double Master’s degree in Computer Science**, awarded with _Summa Cum Laude_ jointly by the **University of Illinois Chicago** and **Politecnico di Milano**. At UIC, I graduated with a **4.0 GPA**, taking advanced coursework in Machine Learning, Causal Inference, and NLP. At Politecnico, I graduated with a final mark of **110L/100** (GPA of 3.82), specializing in Data Mining and Software Engineering.

I also hold a **Bachelor’s degree in Engineering of Computing Systems** from Politecnico di Milano, where I graduated with full marks (110/110).

## 🔬 Research Experience

### Research at UIC
In 2024, I served as a **Graduate Hourly Assistant** at the University of Illinois Chicago, where I developed algorithms for causal discovery in relational settings using graphical models.

### Research at NECSTLab
From 2020 to 2024, I was a **Research Scholar** at the [NECSTLab](https://necst.it/) research laboratory at Politecnico di Milano. I contributed to multiple projects focused on graph algorithms, genome graph analysis, and infrastructure modeling.

Highlighted projects include:
- **CPIExtract**: for my Master’s thesis, I conducted research in collaboration with Northeastern University and **Brigham and Women’s Hospital**, focusing on representation learning for compound-protein interaction (CPI) datasets.
- **GAGET**: i developed a toolkit for evaluating genome assemblies using graph representations.
- **Electric Network Analytics**: I designed domain-specific metrics and web-based tools to analyze structural vulnerabilities in power grids.
